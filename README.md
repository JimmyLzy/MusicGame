# MusicGame
This project is about turning music into a game. Users are able to choose their music from the music library window. The game system will subsequently extracts some main audio features from the music such as pitch, rhythm, timbre, mood and other high-level features. If you are intersted in any implementation details, please read my reports.
All the analysis results are stored under some specific and meaningful folders. Please read my reports to understand how my experiments are carried out and how they can be improved in the future. In addition, please notice that the game will produce a fiel called "FilePathSetting", which contains some informations regarding where the game will search for music.
